# ZeroTierOne-Vita
**Project paused/cancelled**

This project is currently paused (or cancelled) due to the lack of public information about the official ZeroTier controller/server protocol. The controller code is closed source, making full interoperability and reverse engineering impractical or not meaningful at this time.

If the situation changes and the server protocol or controller code becomes available, development may resume.
